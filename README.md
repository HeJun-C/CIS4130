**Project Description**

In this project, I was able to download, store, extract, clean, analyze, and transform an Amazon review dataset from Kaggle. Then, I selected the necessary columns that might be useful for the prediction of the star rating of each review.

Some techniques I used include text encoding, transforming date data into categorical data, encoding categorical data into numeric data, grid search, and cross-validation for the optimized model. 

Then, I evaluated the model performance with numeric metrics including F1 score, precision, and recall, and visual metrics such as a confusion matrix and a ROC curve.
